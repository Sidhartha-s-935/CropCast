## Problem statement

With the world facing the dual challenges of a increasing population and
unpredictable climate change, ensuring global food security has become increasingly
urgent. Our project addresses this critical issue by leveraging advanced technology to
empower farmers with personalized crop yield predictions. This innovative system acts
as a personalized weather report for crops, harnessing various data points such as past
harvest numbers, weather forecasts and soil samples to provide accurate insights into
future crop growth.

## Project Objective

The objective of our project is </br>
To equip farmers with the necessary tools and information</br>
To optimize crop production while minimizing resource waste</br>
To enable farmers to make informed decisions regarding planting times, water
management, and fertilizer usage.

## Technical implemntaion

In our project, we're focusing on gathering and integrating crucial data
points to revolutionize crop yield predictions.
We start by collecting historical crop yield data from farms across
different regions. This includes details on crop types, planting dates,
harvest yields, and any relevant agricultural practices.</br>
Moving on to machine learning model development, we're working on
creating algorithms capable of processing and analyzing all this
integrated data to predict crop yields accurately.By implementing advanced statistical techniques, we're aiming to
identify patterns and correlations between various factors and crop
yield outcomes.</br>
For UI, we're focusing on creating an intuitive and user-friendly
experience accessible via web by utilizing Flask and Python.
